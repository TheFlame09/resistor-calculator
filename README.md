# Resistor Calculator
Welcome to the Resistor Calculator repository! This tool is designed to help you easily calculate the resistance of a resistor by selecting its color bands. Whether you’re a student, hobbyist, or professional in electronics, this calculator will simplify your work and save you time.

## Features
* User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for quick and easy calculations.
* Color Band Input: Supports 3, 4, 5, and 6-band resistors.
* Accurate Calculations: Provides precise resistance values based on standard color codes.
* Educational Tool: Great for learning and teaching about resistor color codes and electronics.
* Background customization: Provides a button to customize the background.
## How to Use
* Dowload the installer on : https://github.com/TheFlame09/resistor-calculator/tree/main/versions/LATEST 
* Select the Number of Bands: Choose whether your resistor has 3, 4, 5, or 6 color bands.
* Input the Colors: Select the color of each band.
* Calculate: Click the “Enter” button to get the resistance value.
* Reset: Click the "Reset" button to reset the value of the resistor.

# Tips for Reading Resistors
 * Always read from left to right.
 * For 3-band resistors, the first band is usually the nearest to the edge.
 * For 5 and 4-band resistors, the tolerance band is usually spaced further apart from the other bands.
 * For 6-band resistors, the tolerance and temperature coefficient bands are typically grouped together at the end.
